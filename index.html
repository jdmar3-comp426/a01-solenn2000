        <h2>The Moirai</h2>
        <p>The Moira, also known as "the Fates" in English, embodied destiny in Greek Mythology.
            These three sisters were the daughters of Zeus. Their mother has changed over time varying from being Nxy
            ("night") and Titaness Themis, the embodiment of divine law.
            They had much power in ensuring that
            mortals lived their lives according to the fate that was assigned to them by the laws
            of the universe.

        <h2>Parallels</h2>
        <p>In Roman mythology,three women known as the Parcae or Fata recite oracle, declarations
            and know of mortals' destiny. Likewise, in Norse mythology, there ia a trio of women called the Norns
            who rule the destiny of both men and gods. The image of three women deciding fate contunues
            in Shakespeare's Macbeth as the "Three witches" and in Dante's Divine Comedy where the Fates are
            mentioned
