        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>The Moira, also known as the Atropos in Greek, originated
            as a daemon (spirit) from the pre-Greek Mycenaean religon.
            An important Mycenaean belief was that all of the events or
            actions were a part of destiny. They accepted inevitability
            in the natural order of things.
        </p>
        <p>The Moirai appear as the personification of fate in the Odyssey,
            but do not yet have separate names. The Moirai are eventually
            elevated to godesses. In Hesiod's poem, they are portrayed as
            godesses who do not only punish men, but also Gods for their sins.
