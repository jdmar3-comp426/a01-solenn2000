        <h2>The Fates with Zeus</h2>
        <p>In the story of <strong>Sarpedon and Hector</strong>, Zeus is aware that
        his son Sarpedon will die. He weighs the destinies,
        learns this outcome, but has no control over it, indicating that even
        powerful Gods like Zeus could not challenge the Three Fates.

        <h2>The Fates at the birth of Meleager</h2>
        <p>The Fates informed Mealeager's mother,Althaea, at his birth, that Meleager
            would live until a log was burnt to ashes. When Meleager killed his uncles, his mother
